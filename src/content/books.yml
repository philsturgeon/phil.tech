    API Developers focus so much on designing and building their APIs, yet often
    we seem to forget the folks on the other end of the line. You, the frontend
    and backend "client developers" trying to integrate the data and functionality into
    your own work, often get left with junky docs, or no docs. This book is your
    guide to navigating a plethora of potential pitfalls and booby traps, and learning
    how to integrate fancy API features like HATEOAS, GraphQL, HTTP/2, etc.

    As soon as I saw what Josh Lockhart and Kris Jordan were doing with PHP The
    Right Way I jumped on board and threw a lot of content in. Since then I have
    been a collaborator on the project, and along with many other contributors
    we put together a huge resource of modern information. This free ebook
    respects the contributions of that website licence, but makes the content
    available in eBook form, PDF, Kindle, etc.
