For the last few days I have been in Barcelona at a brilliant event run by Mozilla called Drumbeat Festival with the slogan "Learning, Freedom and the Web". Unlike the normal Drumbeat events this was a two-day conference/festival and had 400 attendees. This event was focusing on a lot more than just web development which is what interested me, so I threw my name in to help out and went along as a blogger. This article is about my personal experiences of the event, things I have learned, people I have met and what I have taken away from it to use going forwards.

The best way to explain Drumbeat is probably in the words of [Mark Surman](http://www.drumbeat.org/content/mark-surman-drumbeat-3-bullets):

> 1. Mozilla exists to **make sure the internet stays open and awesome**.
> 2. With Drumbeat, we’re **moving beyond Firefox** to build more things that make the web better — **not just software**.
> 3. We’re doing this by reaching out **new kinds of people** — teachers, filmmakers, lawyers, journalists. These people will play a key role in shaping the future of the web.
### Wednesday 3rd November

After I had landed, settled and unpacked I went off in search of fellow Volunteer/Blogger [Matt Jukes](http://twitter.com/jukesie) for a beer. Within the first two hours of being in Spain I was sat in an Irish Bar, drinking French beer, eating fish 'n' chips with a guy who lives two miles from me. Cultural fail, but it was fun. Later we met up with [Graham Brown-Martin](http://www.drumbeat.org/content/mobile-and-disruptive-graham-brown-martin) who I ended up hanging out with for quite a lot of the week. Smart bloke and he handles Absinthe like a trooper.

The Wednesday was light day on official Drumbeat content, with a keynote and a "Science Fair" at the amazing Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art. I'll be honest, I didn't mingle as much as I could have done: grabbing a few free beers and chatting up waitresses, but it was an enjoyable night all the same.

### Thursday 4th November

Second day, first hangover. I had a very interesting evening drinking with a group of locals - who didn't speak a word of English. Dodging traffic and 4 million bikes/scooters/coffee shops/bars taking over the pavements, I set off towards the venue for my first assignment which was a session about Peer Learning and the reuse of Content. Knowing very little about any of this I felt rather out of place; discussing the problems with education to people who train Uni lecturers is bizarre at best.

#### Encourage Content Reuse: Educate your users!

This session was being led by Jane Park from Peer-to-Peer University. We broke off into teams and to discuss how we could improve Content Re-use on the web, identifying the problems and suggesting ways to get around them. In my group we came up with these issues - in no particular order:

1. **Language** – The majority of content is only offered in English
2. **Jealously** - While people may use content from many places, they still want to protect what is ‘theirs’ and don't encourage re-use
3. **Respecting each other’s work** – Creating a sharing culture
4. **Confusion** - What does open mean? Free to read? Free to modify? Reusable? Redistributable? Too many options
5. **Generational Gap** - Lecturers have very different mindsets to sharing content than kids and students these days. Share/blog/tweet _everything _compared to a very closed approach.

What needs to happen?

- Train the trainers to live the experience that the youths are having, pass up new knowledge
- Encourage people to live by "do, ask for forgiveness later" (ie. social cost vs. social gain)
- Policymakers encourage upcoming culture to exist

How do we make that happen?

> Create an amateur space, a digital virtual playground where people can come in without identity and you can build on what each other are doing (forchan?). kids can just do and create their own rules of engagement. remove identity, can allow trainers to be a part of this. you can use this as a model to show policymakers, this is what happens when you take away histories.

Some brilliant suggestions were made from other groups taking very different approaches, including a Firefox extension/feature that would detect certain HTML Metadata and display a license type of content. If I understood it right, the feature would be similar to how "the padlock" shows if the page is secure or not. Something very useful, tangible and easily doable!

#### Webcraft Toolshed: Soft Skills

I left my post realizing that my position didn't need a volunteer and went off to find the code-geeks. I found them (including Chris [Christian Heilmann](http://twitter.com/codepo8) and [Anna Debenham)](http://twitter.com/#!/anna_debenham) all plugged in and Wi-Fied up in the aptly named "Webcraft Toolshed". We spent the next hour or two discussing "What are the core and specialist skills that web professionals need?". A post will be coming this one later for the Drumbeat website, but the basics are:

> 1. **Basic sysadmin skills** - Knowing how your website will be run on the server is very important. If your application will run on Apache or nginx, you'll need to install locally and be sure that your code runs on the live site. You also need to understand performance issues that could arise from your servers specific setup and learn to circumnavigate these potentially problems with your code.
> 2. **Usability** - Unless you are doing something really wrong, the website will be used by somebody. A web professional needs to identify and research who those users will be and make the site usable accordingly.
> 3. **Planning** - Web Professionals of all sorts need to plan. User Flow Diagrams (UFD's), wire-frames, Entity Relationship Diagrams, etc all help minimize errors and coding/design time on small and large projects alike.
#### Create P2PU Webcraft Courses

My third session of the day was brilliant. We moved out of the Webcraft area and wandered around to corner to a bizarre museum full of tall metal spikes and playing cards. We sat on some steps in the corner and discussed what Peer to Peer University is, how it works and how we can get involved. This was interesting to me as I previously had no idea what P2PU was!

The idea behind it is to create groups of motivated people to all learn together. Each course lasts between 6-8 weeks and is done mostly over IRC/e-mail but optionally with meet ups or video chats. Unlike traditional courses these P2PU courses don't have an expert telling everybody what to do. Instead one person (who doesn't need to have all the answers) will be responsible for finding material to learn with and keeping people motivated. The entire group helps each other reach the goals set at the start of the course and comes away with knowledge and several contacts that can be used in the future.

How awesome is that? I have been putting off learning Ruby for over a year now so this seems like a perfect way to do it. I can join forces with like minded developers, learn Ruby with help from others who are at the same level and help other people learn it too. [Vote for this course](http://p2pu.uservoice.com/forums/84091-course-suggestions/suggestions/1202827-ruby-and-rails?ref=title) to make it happen.

That was the last talk I saw, opting instead to follow the social track and wandered off with some new friends to find food and beer. The evening descended into organized madness with a large group of Mozilla people and we got toasted on the roof of a hotel. It was a beautiful view and I had some great conversations. I then had a few that made no sense and went on for far too long... sorry to whoever I bored with my drunken ramblings...

### Friday 5th November

Another challenging morning. Sessions felt like way too much of a struggle so I bummed around moving bins and carrying stuff as a volunteer instead of trying to write anything. I did catch a session about [Sketchpad](http://sketchpad.cc/) which uses a combination of a modified [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/) install and [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) to make collaborative editing of Java applets run in the web with JavaScript in real-time editing. It all seemed like crazy black magic to me, but awesome all the same!

We then all had a chat about [Pyjamas](http://pyjs.org/), Hacker Spaces, Jelly Spaces and all sorts of other geeky things. Hacker Spaces really got me interested as I'd never heard of them before. So, WTF are they?

> Hackerspaces are community-operated physical places, where people can meet and work on their projects.

From what I could gather, its just somewhere (paid for by a membership fee) where geeks can just turn up and work on random projects together. Want to set up an [RFID tribute band](/blog/2010/10/bathcamp-a-day-of-nerdery-and-beer)? This would be the place. Sadly there is nothing in Bristol or Bath but there are [plenty around](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces).

 

Things ended with a party, some Massively Multiplayer Thumb Wars, drinking, conversations and eventually a plane. In all this was a bloody brilliant week. Props to everyone in the Mozilla Drumbeat gang for pulling it off!
