It has taken me several weeks but finally PyroCMS v0.9.5 [PyroCMS v0.9.5.4](http://github.com/philsturgeon/pyrocms/zipball/v0.9.5.3 "Download PyroCMS v0.9.5.4 from GitHub") has been released. This brings many new improvements and while it is still not perfect, I now squashed more bugs than I even care to count.

### Cool new features

- Implemented the jQuery plugin [Ajaxify](http://maxblog.me/ajaxify/) for a large portion of the Admin Panel to give things a nice flare and speed navigation up.
- Replaced [Spaw 2](http://www.spaweditor.com/) WYSIWYG with [TinyMCE](http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/) and allowed basic WYSIWYG editing for smaller textareas.
- Meta data for Pages module, handled with a new jQuery UI tab.
- Auto-meta data for news and other modules.
- Added comments to galleries.
- Fixed captchas (they are still tricky as hell to read, but they work now).
- Settings now use jQuery UI tabs, looking snazzy.
- Added Twitter tab to settings page for easy Twitter integration.

Again, while this may not be a major release it certainly felt like one. I may have introduced a few bugs here but they will be solved shortly.

Also as a new direction I am focusing less on some of the modules like services, products, etc and moving my attention to pages, news, navigation and settings. I feel like these are the modules of core interest, and I will develop the rest as and when they are required by clients.

As always, you can download PyroCMS from the [GitHub downloads](http://github.com/philsturgeon/pyrocms/downloads) page.
