excerpt: There are several reasons for starting this blog. Firstly as a way to keep
  track of all my tips, tutorials, code snippets and various web projects. I like
  to be active in the world of web development and have been knocking out sites and
  libraries for years.

Secondly I wanted somewhere to document other technical projects. I am a great fan of the writers of [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/ "Lifehacker"), who have inspired me to share some of my own suggestions.

Finally, it will be a convenient place to dump my thoughts on PHP, MySQL, Apache, Javascript, and the world of computers in general.

So welcome, and thanks for reading.
