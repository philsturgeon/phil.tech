After several months of totally secret development and two months of private beta [MojoMotor](http://mojomotor.com/) - an amazing new CMS from [EllisLab](http://ellislab.com/) - is out, and I'm finally allowed to talk about it!

[Derek Allard](http://derekallard.com/) showed of this awesome new inline CMS at EECI2010 US and as soon as I saw it I was intrigued. There is basically no backend, just inline editing, spawn-able WYSIWYG areas and a MojoBar at the top of the page for everything else.

You can learn everything you need to from the website so I won't blab on about it too much, but if you like the video and decide to buy it make sure you check out [MojoAddons.com](http://mojoaddons.com/). I'm slightly annoyed after buying Mojo-Addons.com but myself and the owner have come to a partnership arrangement and to be fair he was a lot quicker out of the styles.

I currently have three add-ons out, one paid and two free.

**[Rest](http://mojoaddons.com/index.php/page/rest)**  - MojoAddons

**[Inputs](http://github.com/philsturgeon/mojo-inputs)** - GitHub

**[Variables](http://github.com/philsturgeon/mojo-variables)** - GitHub

Check it out, it's a great CMS for simple little sites. We've had the [CICON2010](http://cicon2010.com/) website running it for a while now and it was smooth even when in beta!
