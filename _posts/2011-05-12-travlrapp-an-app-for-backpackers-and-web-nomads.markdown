excerpt: " \n\tThis summer I'll be travelling around U.S.A with nothing much more
  than a Greyhound coach pass, a laptop, a map and of course a smart-phone. On the
  way I'll be meeting developers, talking at a few offices offering Git/CodeIgniter/Fuel
  training and having several nerd-beers along the way. To help people see what I'm
  up to and to help connect with people as I go I've created a funky web-app: TravlrApp.
  It is a social networking site to help make travelling more social, more manageable
  and more open.  Using services like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Instagram you
  can mark your activity on a map automatically and your friends can see what you've
  been up to. Currently it is in private beta, but invites are available to anyone
  who subscribes on the homepage, and existing users have 10 invites. "

This summer I'll be travelling around U.S.A with nothing much more than a Greyhound coach pass, a laptop, a map and of course a smart-phone. I'm going to coin a phrase here and call myself a "web-nomad", which needs to be a t-shirt.

On the way I'll be meeting developers, talking at a few offices offering Git/CodeIgniter/Fuel training and having several nerd-beers along the way. To help people see what I'm up to and to help connect with people as I go I've created a funky web-app: [TravlrApp](http://travlrapp.com). It is a social networking site to help make travelling more social, more manageable and more open. Using services like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Instagram you can mark your activity on a map automatically and your friends can see what you've been up to. What better way to keep a journal or a "travel log" in the 21st centry?

The idea came to me over a few weeks and is broken down into various sections:

### Planning

Going traveling, I wanted to plan where I could visit, see how far they were apart from each other and throw in some vague dates so I could give rough estimates of when I would be in certain places. If you're going around America for 3 months, it's pretty hard to say when you'll be anywhere. I can say "3 nights here", "1 week here", "leaving here on the 23rd" etc all through a simple interface. I wanted to be able to plan in two stages.  ![Travlr - Friend Map](https://s3.amazonaws.com/philsturgeon-blog/Screen_shot_2011-05-13_at_00.04_.22_.png)Stage 1 is "I'm going to this city for a few days", nice and vague. Stage 2 is "I'm staying in this town/address/whatever between date Y and date Z". Using this site I can do both stages and make things as exact as I want when I want.

### Social Mapping

If I'm wandering around America taking photos, Tweeting and doing all sorts of other stuff on the internet it would be great if that could all be aggregated into one source. Why should my paranoid mother have to check in 20 different places to see if I'm alive and end up phoning me constantly when she forgets how Facebook works when she could just look at one page that has everything on there? Any user can log in and see "Activity" from their friends on their dashboard, along with a list of active friends and even a "Friend Map" which shows where your friends are.

### Showing the trip off

Why do something cool if you can't show it off? That seems to be the point of most new social media websites and it's a pretty valid motive. This is a little more cool than telling everybody you've gone for a run, had a coffee or... GONE TO WORK! \*shockedface\* </gowalladig>

I've created a really simple embeddable version so trips can be shared:

### What's next?

I have a whole bunch of evil plans for TravlrApp. I want to do a lot of work with Places and Checkins, but of course creating an API-agnostic abstraction layer for all the different "Places" data is a bitch. I have a plan, but it's going to take some time. I also have some pretty sweet ideas for "collision detection" of friends and some plans for monetisation and really useful, unobtrusive targeted advertisement. "You're staying here for 4 nights but you haven't booked any accommodation, would you like to stay here with a 20% off discount?" Bam! Everyone is happy.

These will all be part of Phase 2, right now Phase 1 is out there and available to anyone who gets an invite.

Throw me a comment if you want an invitation code, I'll be sending out a batch tomorrow.
