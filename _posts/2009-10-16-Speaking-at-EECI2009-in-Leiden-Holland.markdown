As a massive fan of CodeIgniter I was pretty excited to be attending the EECI2009 conference in Leiden, Holland. It would give me the chance to meet the EllisLabs development team and lots of other CodeIgniter nerds. Now as a last minute replacement I will actually be speaking at the event too!

I found out last week there was a possibility of me speaking and was asked to knock together a topic and summary of what I would like to talk about. This was much harder than I had expected.

My position within the CodeIgniter community is one of mainly support and blogging. I am regularly on the forums and IRC chatroom answering support questions and giving suggestions to users. All of that is very different to trying to think of a talk to give in front of nearly 100 CodeIgniter users as the forum posts always give you a topic to work with! Not only that but if people are paying almost £300 they are going to expect it to be **_good_** to justify the cost. No pressure!

After a week I have come up with an idea for the talk and I am pretty confident it will be worth attending. I do not want to give too much away, but I will basically be talking about taking CodeIgniter beyond being a simple web-framework and help you use the MVC structure and coding methodologies in some rather unexpected ways.

For those of you interested in the talk, I will be posting my material and possibly a video of the talk on my blog afterwards.

Wish me luck!
