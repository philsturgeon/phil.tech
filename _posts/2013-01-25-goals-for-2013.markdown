excerpt: It's that time of year again. Well, it's nearly the end of January but building
  my list of random stupid things to do this year took me a little while to think
  up.

Back in 2010 I set myself a [list of goals](/goals/2010) and put them online in the hope that it would be some extra motivation. I actually [did pretty well](/blog/2010/12/2010-for-phil-sturgeon-year-in-review) I believe, and while a few of them didn't happen I got around to most of them since.

Since then I've focused on other things. My goals for 2011 were mainly "[Backpack around America and Canada](/blog/2011/08/nomadic-web-development) without getting killed or arrested (both nearly happened), then try to not be homeless when I get back to the UK" then 2012 was "Work for as many people as possible, then sort out a visa and get my ass to the USA". 

That was good but now it's time to go again!

### Personal

* Go to Thailand
* Go to New Zealand
* Go to Mexico

### Development

* <s>Build an EmberJS app</s>
* Build an iPhone app

### Career

* <s>Write a book</s> [Catapult into PyroCMS](https://efendibooks.com/books/catapult-into-pyrocms)
* <s>Give a talk not on PHP / PHP Frameworks / PyroCMS / Bla</s> [Become Master of Your Own Universe](http://lanyrd.com/2013/dibi2013/scqxfx/)

### Fitness / Outdoors

* <s>Skydive</s>
* Complete Double-Black Diamond Skiing
* Complete Black Diamond Snowboarding
* <s>Cycle an insanely long way</s> Done a few of these. Boston to New York was certainly the furthest. [Day 1](http://www.strava.com/activities/85322617) [Day 2](http://www.strava.com/activities/85569382) [Day 3](http://www.strava.com/activities/85887673)
* Hike through the Grand Canyon
* <s>QUIT SMOKING FOR GODS SAKE</s> 6 months with only occasional Friday night failure every two weeks or so. I'll take it.

Many of these are not so time consuming or life changing. Last time "Read 10 books" was a mission in between all the freelance and everything else, but now as Lead Engineer of [Kapture](http://kaptu.re) most of my time is taken up, so I have picked things I feel I can achieve at work within our deadlines, and on weekends or holidays.

Maybe nobody cares, but this is helpful for me.
