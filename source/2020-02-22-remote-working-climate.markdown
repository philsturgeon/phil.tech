Companies are stepping up to [go carbon neutral](https://www.climateneutral.org/certified-brands) ([or even carbon negative](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/)), and the number of [big companies offering remote work](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2019/01/15/work-from-home-2019-the-top-100-companies-for-remote-jobs/#d580efe15444) is on the rise, but [remote work in the States is still only 3-5%](https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020), and with most of the world ([especially the U.S.](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/10/Cumulative-CO2-treemap.png)) desperately needing to sort its carbon footprint out, remote working might just be a big piece of the puzzle.

When my U.S. visa was done I sold my car, sold or gave away everything I own to folks in the neighborhood, left the country, and hit the road traveling around Europe on my bike. In this time I have been [raising awareness of the climate crisis](https://offset.earth/articles/climate-emergency/climate-change-by-bike), and [fundraising a shitload of trees](https://offset.earth/philsturgeon), all of which is all possible thanks to [Stoplight](stoplight.io/) supporting remote work.

Whichever approach you take, and we'll get into them in a moment, not being forced to center your entire life around getting to a specific place every Monday to Friday opens up a lot of opportunities to improve the quality of life, _and_ massively lower your carbon footprint, which improves quality of life for everyone everywhere.

## Commuting Sucks and Kills Us All

Commuting sucks, regardless of the transportation you chose. Car, train, bike, hoverboard; going to the same place every single day is uninteresting at best. 

![](images/article_images/2020-02-18-remote-work-climate/car.png)

The average annual carbon footprint is 10 tonnes in many developed countries, and in America it's 20 tonnes. The recommended footprint for a sustainable environment is 2.3 tonnes, so... fuck! Driving alone is enough to sail straight past that target, meaning if you even breath at any point in the year you're actively contributing to the destruction of the human race.

![](images/article_images/2020-02-18-remote-work-climate/footprint-guide.png)

Trains are better for the environment (depending on the power source) and with your hands freed up for entertainment or other productive tasks, but going to the same train station every day is not the best. Even if you love cycling, riding the same route every day to and from the same bloody office gets very mundane very quickly. 

The average American commutes for an hour each way to and from work. For example, my mate used to drive from south New Jersey to Brooklyn every day, which is a 1hr drive when traffic is normal. That is 6kg (13lb) of CO2 emissions of each way. That is 240kg (530lb) a _month_, and over 262 working days that's a ridiculous 3,144kg (6,931lb) of CO2 emissions. That is 3.14 metric tonnes, just to go to the office, and that is 16-33% of the average persons annual carbon footprint.

Imagine if more people just... **didn't**.

For me, I take that 1-2 hour each way hell-commute, and turn it into a 3-4 hour a day bike ride. Sometimes all in the morning, sometimes one big midday ride, sometimes one hour on, one hour off. It all depends on my calendar, the terrain, and the weather. I try and keep Alp crossing to the weekend, and in the week I just make sure I've cycled somewhere I can work. 

## Looking Your Best is Exhausting

There are countless other benefits, even the seemingly irrelevant "less time/money on makeup" has wins. Lots of makeup uses palm oil, which comes from deforesting million of hectares of rainforest, which are usually [habitat for orangutans](https://orangutanfoundation.org.au/palm-oil/). We're losing a football field of rainforest every bloody second, mostly for dumb shit like this. Anything that helps reduce demand is going to help us breath, and maybe we will still have orangutans in 2025.

This same idea extends to other parts of our appearances, like clothing. The fashion industry produces 10% of the worlds carbon emissions, and despite peoples best intentions, 85% of clothing donations end up in landfill.

I've never been into fashion, but now I barely buy clothes at all. I own one pair of trousers, two t-shirts, two pairs of boxers, two pairs of socks, one cold weather cycling top & bottom, one warm weather cycling top & bottom, a few pairs of gloves, and a beanie. That's it. I've learned to repair them, initially just so I didn't have to worry about finding replacements on the road, but now for the environmental benefits too. 

After all who gives a shit how I look when I'm bike nomading? I get work done on the side of the road, park benches, cafes, wherever I feel like stopping. I'm happy in my Power Ranger costume, and nobody else seems to care.

I love not needing to waste time, money, and energy resources on doing laundry, I just occasionally hand wash the few things I own, and dry them in the sun. Sometimes I lash things onto the rear rack and let them dry while I ride. 

## Un-rushed Vacations

When talking to people about [going flight free](https://offset.earth/articles/climate-emergency/flight-free-holidays-a-practical-guide), the most common response is "but other transportation is so slow, I'll spend my whole vacation getting there!" Fair. The number of paid vacation days employees receive varies massively all around the world, with New Zealand offering 30 and the U.S. (whilst companies are legally not required to give any) the average is 16 days a year. 

Remote work solves this problem. Right now I'm on vacation in Morocco. I remote worked my way down to Marrakesh, bike-commuting through Portugal and Spain a little bit each day, and now I'm spending a week offline cycling around the Atlas Mountains. If I was still chained to a desk then getting here flight free would have been rough. London to Marakkesh is 37 hours on public transportation, switching in Paris, Barcelona, and Cordoba. 

The rational part of your brain knows that flying is killing the planet, but other parts of your brain push that aside, telling you that you deserve a break from the stress of normal life, and the budget 5 hour flight seems inifinitely more appealing.

The default of flying is ridiculusly pervasive, to a point where lots of otherwise well intentioned people don't even consider the alternatives. I stayed with a lovely couple in Lisbon ([Couchsurfing](https://couchsurfing.com/) ftw!) who were planning a trip to see some family in Azerbaijan. They were intrigued when I told them I was not flying, but they said there was no other way for them to get there. I whipped out [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) and showed them the alternatives.

They were amazed to see there was a train route the whole way there, but put off when they realized it would take 4.5 days. He commented that it would require vacation time to get there, because it would not fit in a single weekend.

When you're working remote, you don't have to get all the way to wherever you're going in one ice-cap melting jump, you can take your time. I asked if they've ever wanted to go to Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, or any of the thousand other places along this train route, and a lightbulb pinged above their heads.

Lisbon to Paris one weekend (night trains!), remote work in Paris for a week, train to Moscow the weekend after, and hang out there a bit... all without using up any vacation time. Or, slow it down even more. One weekend is travel, the next is exploring, and you still get all the time either side of working (where you aren't commuting either!) to check out wherever you are. 

This is a signature move of digital slowmad. Remote workers are often concerned to go slowmad because it sounds expensive paying for somewhere to stay when you already have rent, but...

## Leaving Home to Work Away

Leaving home for sustained periods of time can start to feel pricey. For example, you're paying rent in one place, but you've gone off on a two month long digital slowmad adventure. If you've got infinite money this is fine, but for the rest of us this is daunting. 

Airbnb is one approach, but it can also be tough to find people looking for longer stays, as many Airbnb stays are just weekends, weeks, or maybe two. You can get a [cleaning service](https://turnoverbnb.com/) to look after the place between short stays, but at this point you're basically running a small business, and in some countries you have the tax complications to go with it.

Another alternative is [Home Exchange](https://www.homeexchange.com/). Through this site you can do direct swaps, so no money changes hands. Or, you can let people stay at your house in return for points which you can use elsewhere. I know folks who will wait for an offer to come in, do the straight swap, then train over there and that's their slowmading sorted, and maybe a vacation too if they love the place. 

This is cheaper than budget package holidays, less shit, and drastically better for the environment.

## Where to Get Work Done?

When I started at Stoplight I was mostly writing code, and reviewing pull requests. Later on I moved to product planning. All of which easy to do asynchronously so it never mattered what timezone I was in. I could chose an "American day" or "European day" depending on what was coming up. Need to ride 80km and get over the Serbian border today? That'll be a 4pm-10pm working day for me! 

The flexibility of true remote work when done properly means time doesn't matter, and when there's a meeting I can just pull the bike over and talk anywhere. After 90 days my U.K. phone service provider Three kicked me off, deciding I was not "on vacation" anymore, but my U.S. Sprint contract continued to work just fine. It was $25 a week extra for unlimited data anywhere, which is pricer than some approaches but I consistently thought this trip was ending "next month" for about a year, so some decisions were not made with full awareness. 

I was getting work done on picnic benches by lakes in Sweden, and in my tent, and calling in from farmers fields in Bosnia, ghost-town train stations in Wales, the occasional McDonalds, hard shoulders of highways, and once still riding the bike. AirPods are amazingly good at getting rid of background noise and wind somehow. If it's hot, sit under a tree. If it's cold, put your jacket on. If it's raining, keep riding until you find somewhere dry. No air conditioning required!

If that sounds terrible to you, there's some way more mainstream approaches to getting work done.

### Mates House

There is one element of working from home which can mess up your carbon footprint. When you're in an office and the house is empty, you've got your heating and cooling turned off (or bloody well should have). That means many people are collectively getting benefits from the same air conditioning, versus everyone's house being heated or cooled independently. 

There are a few ways you can reduce the impact here, like improving insultation, only heating/cooling the room you work in, which should be a smaller office and not the biggest room in the house, etc. 

Another approach is to team up with local remoters and share resources. If you've got friends nearby who also work remote, you can take it in turns to all work from their house, cycling over there or maybe driving around the corner when the weather sucks, all of which is still lower than a) driving far into the office, and b) heating indidivual houses. It's also more fun to work with friends. If you don't have any work-from-home friends, you could try making some, or converting some friends to working from home. 

This approach is not so handy for people who move around, unless you've got friends spread around where you're going, but there are many other options.

### Coworking Spaces

WeWork is the worst in many ways, and it's useless for nomads, slomads, or anyone who just wants a desk for a few days or weeks. It's exceptionally terrible for climate crisis aware humans. Just like all Starbucks coffee is intentioanlly a little burned so that wherever you are, it tastes the same, all WeWork's are inexplicably freezing in summer, boiling in winter. For some reason, that is their brand. 

There are a million co-working spaces around the world, and they're not just in the biggest cities in the country, they're everywhere. Take a look at [Coworker.com](https://www.coworker.com/) to find spaces, get day passes, or book longer stretches. They recently launched [Global Pass](https://www.coworker.com/global-pass) which lets you buy a bunch of credits to then use all over the world.

### Trains

Trains are a pretty great place to work. I worked for three days on the Amtrak from Seattle to New York, and I had both a mobile hotspot and train WiFi the whole way - except for North Dakota. There is _nothing_ in North Dakota.

The train from Tangier to Marrakesh was awesome views, and I got to review the VS Code extension for [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral). More on that in another post.

### Ferries

Sometimes there is water in the way of where you‚Äôre trying to go, but this form of slow travel usually comes with free or cheap WiFi. Make sure you turn off your mobile roaming because many ships offer their own Mobile Network which costs a bloody ridiculous amount, but their WiFi is the same or cheaper than flight WiFi and handles video calls just fine.

I know ferries do not seem like an envionrmentally friendly way to get around. [Some ferries](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/worlds-second-largest-ferry-operator-switching-from-diesel-to-batteries) are [switching to electric](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50233206), but most ferries are honking great diesel machines. That said, ferries are carrying 50-100 trucks, and the average person weighs about as much as one of their spare tyres, so your part of the footprint is almost negligible.

Emissions data from DfT:

* Ferry foot passenger: 0.02kg CO2e per passenger km
* Ferry car passenger: 0.13kg CO2e per passenger km
* Flights, domestic: 0.3kg CO2e per passenger km

> Every journey is different, but ferry about ten times less polluting if travelling by bike. ‚Äî **Source**: [@FlightFree2020 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FlightFree2020/status/1213165841753214977)

Getting a days work done while you float over the sea from Denmark to Norway is pretty spectacular, and you can walk around as much as you like. If you need to get somewhere over the sea for a conference, work meetup, company "summit", whatever, then ferry can be a good choice.

TODO image from norway?

At some point this year I'll be moving to the States again, which involes a [8 day cargo ship](http://www.freightercruises.com/) from Le Harve to New York City. That's not no carbon footprint, but it's 10% that of a flight, and avoiding the [high altitude emissions](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/transportation_and_global_warming/airplane_emissions/) has benefits too.
