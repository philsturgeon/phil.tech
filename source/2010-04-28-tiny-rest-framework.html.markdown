title: Tiny REST framework in PHP
category: php
alias: blog/2010/04/tiny-rest-framework
excerpt: Based on Twiny framework and my CodeIgniter REST server I have created a  really
  simple RESTful framework that lets you use CodeIgniter style  controllers without
  any of the extra weight of using a whole framework.  It lets you handle GET, POST,
  PUT, DELETE requests with ease and return  data in XML, JSON, HTML tables, Serialize,
  PHP syntax and CSV.

I figured it is about time I start selling some of my work as the number of libraries and projects I have released open-source means I spent a silly amount of time answering support requests for free. As a step towards financial gain from coding I figured I'd give [CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/) a try, which so far is going fairly well.

I have created a really simple _standalone_ RESTful framework that lets you use CodeIgniter style controllers without any of the weight of using a whole framework. It lets you handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests with ease and return data in XML, JSON, HTML tables, Serialize, PHP syntax and CSV.

Sound familiar? Well it should! The codebase is based on my CodeIgniter REST\_Controller which has been out for a long time now. It was a big part of my EECI2009 talk "Slides: Igniting your web-service") and was the basis of my recent NetTuts article [Working with RESTful Services in CodeIgniter](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/working-with-restful-services-in-codeigniter-2/).

Anyway, if you like my `CodeIgniter REST_Controller` but do not always want to have CodeIgniter on your REST server, give this a try. It is only 3 PHP files: `index.php`, `config.php` and `REST.php` class file then a `.htaccess` and your controllers. Very lightweight, very easy to use and incredibly useful for flexible RESTful APi's.

For only $7, what do you have to lose?
