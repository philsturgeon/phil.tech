I've been programming since I was about 12, writing awful messes in spaghetti PHP. 14 years later and I have learned how to a) program in languages other than PHP, and, b) make PHP be a better place in a few small ways.

I love to explore new technologies, try new methodologies, and keep building bigger & better things. I am not always a quick learner, but when I'm doing smashing my head against a wall on something I can usually turn it around into easily digestible blogs, tutorials, screencasts or conference talks.

Luckily my last job at [Kapture] - a trendy startup that went beeswax - and my new job with [Ride] - an awesome carpool company which has just launched - lets me do a lot of that. I've been writing a bunch of Rails, a fair bit of Go and using stuff I never got to use being a CodeIgniter-on-demand-freelance-monkey for way too many years.
